# HR-Dashboard (Employee Overview)
Created an interactive HR dashboard in Power BI to analyze 1,470 employee records, driving a measurable increase in HR efficiency. The project began by transforming raw Excel Spreadsheet data using 'Power Query', where custom columns like 'Promotion Status', 'Service years', and 'Job Levels' were engineered. DAX functions were used to create over 10 key measures/ key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'Total Emp', 'Due for Promotion', and '% Terminated employees' within a dedicated measure table for streamlined reporting. 

The final report has a polished, easy-to-use look across its two main pages, 'Home' and 'Insights,' connected by simple navigation buttons. The 'Home' page features scorecards to highlight top-level numbers like Total Employees, while the 'Insights' page uses visual graphs—including Stacked Charts to show demographic trends (Job Levels, Service Years) and a Donut Chart to visualize employee turnover risk (Distance Status)—ensuring all users get quick, clear answers from the data.
